# General rules

- be honest
- when it make sense structure response as numbered list of points

# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

- core documentation entry point is `README.md`
- `docs/demo_requirements.md` defines demo scope, constraints, and credibility success criteria
- `docs/steps.md` defines the execution plan and delivery steps to implement the demo
- `docs/components.plantuml` and `docs/components.png` define JVM/jar responsibilities and runtime connections

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `mvn clean test` — run unit tests (JUnit 5) via Surefire.
- `mvn verify` — full pipeline: unit + integration tests, JaCoCo coverage check (80% bundle minimum, zero missed classes), and dependency check.
- `mvn clean site` — generates static analysis reports (PMD, Checkstyle, SpotBugs) plus coverage/site docs; use before submitting PRs.
- `mvn clean package -DskipTests` — build the jar when you need a fast local iteration (avoid for PRs).

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- Java 17; use the repository’s `eclipse-formatter.xml` profile (4-space indentation, no tabs).
- Package namespace is `org.hestiastore.index...`; keep new modules under this root.
- Try to avoid of inner classes like Enums and Exceptions, store them into separate files.
- Prefer clear, descriptive class names (e.g., `*Adapter`, `*Cache`, `*Descriptor`) and follow existing suffixes for test doubles (`*Test`, `*IT`).
- Add Javadoc for public types and non-trivial logic; keep methods small and side-effect aware.
- Do not use fully qualified class names in code.
- Always use simple class names with explicit `import` statements (e.g. `import package.ConcreteClass`).
- Try to avoid creating class instances in constructors.
- Try to centralize class instantiation in builder classes.

## Testing Guidelines

- Write JUnit 5 tests with Mockito for mocks; place fast, deterministic cases in `src/test/java`.
- Use annotations ans static imports in test classes.
- Integration scenarios that touch filesystem or concurrency should go to `src/integration-test/java` with `*IT` suffix.
- Use in-memory `MemDirectory` for unit tests to avoid disk coupling; clean up temp files when touching the filesystem.
- New code must satisfy the JaCoCo gate (80% instruction coverage and no missed classes) and keep tests isolated/parallel-safe.
- junit test all corner cases
- for each changed production class make sure there is same class name `*Test` in corresponding package.
- If junit test class use mocks annotate class annotate class with @ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class.
- For each mocked parameter create private class field.
- When tested class have to be instantiated than do it in `setUp()` and `teadDown()` methods.
- instead of try{}finally{} use try-with-resources statement. 

## Refactoring guidelines

- refactoring backlog lives in `docs/refactor-backlog.md`
- each reafactoring step ha unique id and brackets to identified what;s done [ ]
- task that are done are moved to section "## Done (Archive)" and are marked as done
- only tasks with ID started with M are maintenance task and even after perfoming are not marked as done and are not moved below. The could be repeated after some time again.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- Follow the existing log style: short, imperative titles that describe the change (e.g., “Improve segment cache eviction logic”); stay under ~72 characters.
- Open or reference an issue before sizable work. In PRs, include a concise summary, linked issue, and test results (`mvn verify` output). Add screenshots only when UI/docs visuals change.
- Keep PRs focused and small; note any breaking changes or config flags in the description.
